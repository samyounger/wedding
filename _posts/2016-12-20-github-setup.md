    DESCRIPTION: GitHub is an online storage source for developers to save their code and collaborate on group projects. It is free to use and immensely useful for developers to share their projects. In addition Git has version control functionality, and so projects can be saved, rolled-back in case of errors, and you can see your progress i.e. no code is ever lost.

Go to the site below and create a new account.

<https://github.com/>

## Create a new repository for the project

  * Top right click the + button, and 'New repository'
  * Enter a name for the project (do not use spaces)
  * Give the project a simple description
  * Leave the repository as Public, unless you wish to pay for a private one (starts at c. $7/m). Public means anybody can view your projects code and copy it
  * Click the box to initialize the repository with a README file.
  * Click 'Create repository'

## Invite me as a collaborator
  * In the project repository, click Settings, and then Collaborators from the left-hand menu
  * If you type in 'samyounger' I should be the only option that appears.

## After project completion
Once the project has been completed, the website is up and running, and my work is completed, you can remove me as a collaborator on your project and retain full control of the work that has been done. Then if any future developers want to work on the project, they can see all the development progress from before.
